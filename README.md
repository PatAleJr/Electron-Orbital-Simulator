# Big-Chem-Project
A Unity project for my high school chemistry teacher. HTML build on itch.io: https://patale.itch.io/electron-orbital-simulator 
Its a program that displays visual models of electron orbitals so people can better understand the structure of the atom.
This project folder can be opened with Unity, or Unity Hub.
